Browser extensions can pose security risks in several ways:

Unauthorized access to personal data: Some extensions may request access to sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or browsing history. If an extension has access to this data, it can be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft or financial fraud.
Password stealing: Malicious extensions can steal passwords or other sensitive information from users. This can be done through keylogging, form grabbing, or other techniques.
Installation of malware or adware: Some extensions may install malware or adware on a user's device. This can lead to a range of problems including slowed system performance, pop-up ads, and even ransomware attacks.
Disruption of browser performance or stability: Some extensions may cause browser crashes, freezes, or other stability issues. This can be due to conflicts between extensions or other issues.
Interference with other browser extensions or plugins: Some extensions may interfere with other extensions or plugins, causing problems such as conflicts or unexpected behavior

Only install extensions from trusted sources: Only install extensions from the official browser store or other trusted sources. Be cautious of extensions that are not from trusted sources.
Read reviews and check ratings: Read reviews and check ratings for the extension before installing. This can help you understand the extension's behavior and potential issues.
Be cautious of extensions that ask for excessive permissions: Be cautious of extensions that request excessive permissions. This may indicate that the extension is malicious or has malicious intentions.
Regularly review and update installed extensions: Regularly review and update installed extensions to ensure they are secure and functioning correctly.
